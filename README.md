### :shipit: Funny facts about me

<p>

<img align="right" alt="avoiding-internet" src="./images/funny-jacket.gif" width="150"><p align="left">As a dedicated professional in the field of Web Development, I refrain from using any social media except for LinkedIn. Initially skeptical, I've come to appreciate LinkedIn for its opportunities to connect with interesting professionals and access valuable knowledge. I's been a great place for me to keep learning from others. There are so many opportunities to share knowledge, have interesting conversations, and join communities specific to our industries.</p>
